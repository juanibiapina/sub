# Summary: CLI implementation of Hello World
#
# A "Hello, World!" program is generally a simple computer program which outputs
# (or displays) to the screen (often the console) a message similar to "Hello,
# World!" while ignoring any user input. A small piece of code in most
# general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a
# language's basic syntax. A "Hello, World!" program is often the first written
# by a student of a new programming language,[1] but such a program can also be
# used as a sanity check to ensure that the computer software intended to compile
# or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands
# how to use it.
